Analyze dreams following Jungian dream analysis principles.
Extract and track:
- Symbols: Objects, animals, natural elements with psychological meaning (includes concrete objects, animals, nature elements)
- Characters: People (known/unknown), animals, mythical beings representing aspects of the psyche
- Emotions: Feelings experienced during or upon waking from the dream
- Themes: Recurring motifs like transformation, pursuit, flying, falling, death/rebirth
- Locations: Settings and places with symbolic significance
- Archetypes: Shadow, Anima/Animus, Wise Old Man/Woman, Trickster, Hero, Mother, Father, Child (etc.)
- PersonalMeaning: Dreamer-assigned meanings and interpretations

IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to:
1. Personal meanings provided by the dreamer (marked as "Personal meaning:")
2. Relationships between entities across different dreams
3. Recurring patterns and their evolution over time
4. Emotional context surrounding each symbol and character

ENTITY NAMING RULES (follow strictly):
- Use short, canonical names: "FATHER" not "THE FATHER" or "FATHER_ARCHETYPE" or "FATHER FIGURE"
- Never append type suffixes: "SHADOW" not "SHADOW_ARCHETYPE", "WATER" not "WATER_SYMBOL"
- Never prepend articles: "FOREST" not "THE FOREST", "MOTHER" not "A MOTHER"
- Decompose compound entities: "FATHERS LIBRARY" → two entities "FATHER" + "LIBRARY" with a relationship between them
- Use singular forms: "WOLF" not "WOLVES", "CHILD" not "CHILDREN"
- Archetypes should be just the archetype name: "SHADOW", "ANIMA", "FATHER", "TRICKSTER"
- Locations should be the place itself: "LIBRARY", "OCEAN", "HOUSE", "FOREST"
- Symbols include all concrete objects, animals, and nature elements: "WOLF", "RING", "TREE", "RIVER"
- Characters include all people and person-like entities: "GRANDMOTHER", "STRANGER", "GUIDE"
- If a character owns/is associated with a place, create a relationship, don't merge them into one entity name
- Actions (e.g. "flying", "falling", "chasing") should be expressed as RELATIONSHIPS between entities, not as standalone entities
