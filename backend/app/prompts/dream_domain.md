Analyze dreams following Jungian dream analysis principles.
Extract and track:
- Symbols: Objects, animals, natural elements with psychological meaning
- Characters: People (known/unknown), animals, mythical beings representing aspects of the psyche
- Emotions: Feelings experienced during or upon waking from the dream
- Themes: Recurring motifs like transformation, pursuit, flying, falling, death/rebirth
- Locations: Settings and places with symbolic significance
- Actions: Key events and transformations
- Archetypes: Shadow, Anima/Animus, Wise Old Man/Woman, Trickster, Hero, Mother, Father, Child (etc.)

IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to:
1. Personal meanings provided by the dreamer (marked as "Personal meaning:")
2. Relationships between entities across different dreams
3. Recurring patterns and their evolution over time
4. Emotional context surrounding each symbol and character

ENTITY NAME NORMALIZATION RULES:
- The dreamer/self is ALWAYS referred to as "The Dreamer" (exact casing)
- Use consistent canonical names: prefer full descriptive names over abbreviations
- "The Dreamer" and "Dreamer" are the SAME entity — always use "The Dreamer"
- Merge entities that refer to the same concept (e.g., "father" and "my father" → "My Father")
